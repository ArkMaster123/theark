# Tasks for Interactive Tutorial System Implementation

## Relevant Files

- `components/tutorial-system.tsx` - Main component for managing the tutorial system's state and flow.
- `components/tutorial-system.test.tsx` - Unit tests for the tutorial system component.
- `components/tutorial-prompt.tsx` - Component for displaying tutorial instructions and guidance.
- `components/tutorial-progress.tsx` - Component for displaying tutorial progress indicator.
- `lib/tutorial-state.ts` - State management for tutorial progression and persistence.
- `lib/tutorial-state.test.ts` - Unit tests for tutorial state management.
- `hooks/use-tutorial.ts` - Custom hook for components to access tutorial state and actions.
- `hooks/use-tutorial.test.ts` - Unit tests for the tutorial hook.
- `lib/world-environment.ts` - Needs modifications to support tutorial object highlighting and interaction detection.
- `components/character-world.tsx` - Needs modifications to integrate the tutorial system.
- `components/visual-cue.tsx` - Component for rendering arrows, highlights, and other visual guidance elements.
- `components/tutorial-reward.tsx` - Component for displaying completion rewards and celebrations.
- `styles/tutorial.css` - Styles specific to tutorial UI components.
- `types/tutorial.ts` - TypeScript interfaces and types for the tutorial system.

### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing.
- The tutorial system should be built as a modular overlay on the existing game rather than deeply modifying existing game logic.
- Use localStorage for persisting tutorial progress until a proper backend is implemented.
- Visual cues should be implemented as SVG or Canvas elements to maintain the pixel art aesthetic.
- Use `npm test` to run all tests, or `npm test -- -t "test name"` to run specific tests.
