# Product Requirements Document: Interactive Tutorial System

## Introduction/Overview
The Ark World currently lacks a structured onboarding experience for new players. Players must rely on a static instructions panel to understand game mechanics, which can be overwhelming and easily missed. An interactive tutorial system will guide new players through core game mechanics in a contextualized, step-by-step manner, improving first-time user experience and increasing engagement. This feature will introduce game elements progressively through guided tasks rather than explaining everything at once.

## Goals
1. Reduce the learning curve for new players by 50%
2. Increase completion rate of first-time play sessions (users playing for at least 5 minutes) by 30%
3. Improve player understanding of core game mechanics as measured by successful completion of basic actions
4. Decrease reliance on the static instructions panel by 70%
5. Enhance overall player satisfaction with the first-time experience

## User Stories
- As a new player, I want guided instructions on how to move my character so I can learn the controls without frustration
- As a new player, I want a step-by-step introduction to game mechanics so I don't feel overwhelmed
- As a new player, I want contextual hints when I'm stuck so I can progress in the game
- As a new player, I want to earn rewards for completing tutorial tasks so I feel accomplished
- As a returning player, I want to be able to skip the tutorial so I don't have to repeat content I already know

## Functional Requirements

### Tutorial Trigger and Flow
1. The tutorial must automatically start when a new player enters the game world for the first time
2. The system must provide a visible option to skip the tutorial for returning players
3. The tutorial must progress linearly through a series of guided tasks
4. The system must detect when a player completes each tutorial step and automatically advance to the next step
5. The tutorial must allow players to complete steps at their own pace without time pressure

### Tutorial Content
6. The tutorial must include the following lessons in sequence:
   - Basic movement using arrow keys
   - Navigating paths and different terrain types
   - Understanding the minimap
   - Finding and interacting with Orb (greeting)
   - Locating key landmarks (house, bridge, chest)
   - Completing a simple task from Orb
7. Each tutorial step must include a clear, concise instruction displayed prominently on screen
8. The system must highlight relevant UI elements or game objects during each step (e.g., highlighting the minimap when explaining navigation)
9. The tutorial must include visual cues (arrows, glowing effects) to guide players toward their next objective

### Feedback and Progress
10. The system must provide immediate positive feedback when players successfully complete each step
11. The tutorial must show a visible progress indicator (e.g., "Step 3/6")
12. The system must detect when players appear stuck (inactive for >30 seconds) and offer additional hints
13. Upon tutorial completion, the system must reward the player with a visual celebration effect and a small in-game reward
14. The tutorial must save progress in case the player exits mid-tutorial

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- The tutorial will not teach advanced game mechanics beyond the core interactions
- The tutorial will not include voice narration or audio instructions
- The tutorial will not restrict player movement or force them to follow a specific path
- The tutorial will not include complex branching paths or multiple completion methods
- The tutorial will not replace the existing instructions panel (which will remain accessible)
- The tutorial will not include a comprehensive explanation of the world's lore or backstory

## Design Considerations
- Tutorial prompts should use the existing pixel art style with a semi-transparent background
- Instructions should appear in a consistent location (bottom center of screen) to avoid obscuring important game elements
- Visual cues should be distinct but not overwhelming (subtle animations rather than flashing elements)
- Progress indicators should be minimalistic and fit the game's aesthetic
- Tutorial UI elements should be accessible and readable (adequate text size and contrast)
- Consider using character speech bubbles for Orb to deliver tutorial instructions in a more immersive way

## Technical Considerations
- The tutorial system should be implemented as a separate module that can be loaded/unloaded
- Tutorial state should be persisted using the same storage mechanism as other game state
- The system should detect player actions by hooking into existing input and collision detection systems
- Implementation should minimize performance impact during regular gameplay
- The tutorial system should be designed to be easily expandable for adding new steps in the future
- Consider implementing an event-based architecture to decouple tutorial progression from specific game actions

## Success Metrics
- At least 80% of new players complete the entire tutorial
- Average time to complete first task should decrease by 50% compared to pre-tutorial implementation
- Player retention after 1 day should increase by 25%
- Direct feedback survey should show at least 4/5 average rating for the tutorial's helpfulness
- Support questions about basic gameplay should decrease by 60%

## Open Questions
- Should the tutorial be replayable after completion? If so, how would players access it?
- What specific reward should players receive for completing the tutorial?
- How should we handle players who deliberately ignore tutorial prompts?
- Should tutorial progress be tied to account-level progress or device-level progress?
- How can we gather accurate metrics on tutorial effectiveness without disrupting gameplay?
- Should there be an option to adjust tutorial verbosity for different player experience levels?
